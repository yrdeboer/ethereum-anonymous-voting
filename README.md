# Anoymous voting on the ethereum blockchain
A voting dapp that lets people do a vote completely anonymous.

It works as follows:

1. The "ceremony leader" creates a new election via the main page.
2. For each voter a card is displayed with a new ethereum account,
   together with instructions to cast the vote (this presumes the
   voters are semi-ethereum savvy).
3. The intention is to distribute these cards among the voters without anyone knowing who has which card, not even the ceremony leader.
4. The voters can cast their votes and the dapp site tracks the progress.

There is also the possibility to make a small donation to me :)

Note: Currently deployed on Rinkeby (so not yet to the main ethereum network).
