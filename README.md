# Anoymous voting on the ethereum blockchain
A fun voting dapp that lets people do a vote completely anonymous with the results results recorded on the ethereum blockchain.

It works as follows:

1. The "ceremony leader" creates a new election via the main page.
2. For each voter a card is displayed with a new ethereum account,
   together with instructions to cast the vote using MetaMask, Mist, etc.
3. The intention is to distribute these cards among the voters without anyone knowing who has which card, not even the ceremony leader, but that's up to the party.
4. The voters can cast their votes and the dapp site tracks the progress.

There is also the possibility to make a voluntary donation to me :)

Note: Currently deployed on Rinkeby (so not yet to the main ethereum network).
