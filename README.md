# Anoymous voting on the ethereum blockchain
A voting dapp that lets people do a vote completely anonymous.

It works as follows:

1. Someone creates a new election via the main page.
2. For each voter a card is displayed with a new ethereum account,
   together with instructions to cast the vote (this presumes the
   voters are semi-ethereum savvy).
3. The voters can cast their votes and the dapp site tracks the progress.

There is also the possibility to make a small donation to me :)

It was great fun creating this dapp and I'm off to even greener pastures, cheers!
