# Anoymous voting on the ethereum blockchain

## The journey
Developing this decentralised application (dapp) was fun and extremly fruitful in my journey to become a blockchain developer.

Sure, it won't make me rich and you will soon enough see that I'm no front-end developer/designer.

Nevertheless, it is full-fledged end-to-end working dapp on the ethereum blockchain and I'm proud of it :)


## The goal
This dapp lets people do a vote completely anonymously while the voting results results will be recorded on the ethereum blockchain.


It works as follows:


1. A "ceremony leader" creates a new election via the main page.
2. For each voter a card is displayed with a new ethereum account,
   together with instructions to cast the vote using MetaMask, Mist, etc.
3. The intention is to distribute these cards among the voters without anyone knowing who has which card, not even the ceremony leader (but that's up to the party, they could also just write their vote on the card, but where's the fun in that).
4. The voters can cast their votes and the dapp tracks the progress and stores it on the ethereum blockchain.


There is also the possibility to make a voluntary donation to me :)
